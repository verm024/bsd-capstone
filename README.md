# Bantuan Sosial Detector (BSD) - BSDTeam Bangkit 2021

## Project Overview
Indonesian Government data shows that 82.8% of survey respondents stated that this Covid-19 pandemic has severely affected their economy. The government then intervened by providing Bantuan Sosial (BanSos) to the community. However, the reality shows that the distribution system is still not good, with data that is not transparent and the BanSos distribution of BanSos is not right on target. Here, we come up with BanSos Detector, a project to make an android application that can be used to monitor the distribution of the Bantuan Sosial. BanSos Detector will also implement machine learning to determine the appropriate recipients of Bantuan Sosial.

## Steps to use
Android:
1. Clone this repository

Machine Learning:
1. Clone this repository
2. If you just want to test the code, then you can open the code and run all the cell through Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab
3. If you want to deploy the model, run the model in the SavedModel folder using [TFServe](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving)
4. For the deployed version, you can access and hit the model API via your External IP Address
